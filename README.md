## Project-Description
I linked my app.js to my html file  then I built out my html with 4 sections stored them in an array and then used a loop to go over them.
I then created an unordered list... which dynamically built my navigation menu. I added eventlistenners to listen and perform certain function which aids the dynamic building of the navigation menu.

I added functionality to show and distinguish which section is in view by addimg eventlistenners and a classlist.
Also added a functionality that allows the sections to scroll into view when I click on a nav item.
added an active state of my nav items... to show section is in viewport
